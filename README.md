## Build tools & versions used
Xcode 14.2, iOS 16.2

## Steps to run the app
Clone this repo. Open the app in Xcode. Run on any iOS simulator.

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
I spent most of my time focusing on creating a UI that could show most of the data without being too overwhelming to the user. I also spent a lot of time ensuring that the image caching worked as intended.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
It was a fun challenge to display as much of the data as possible in the list while keeping the UI clean and not overwhelming to the user. Also I have used libraries for image caching in the past and this time I wanted my own implementation to tweak and refine. 

## How long did you spend on this project?
8 hours

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
I focused more on creating a succinct UI and less time thinking of edge cases. With more time I would put more effort into giving the user more clear information in the cases of an error loading the data. I would have also spent time adding more unit tests. 

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I sorted the directory by name by default. I wanted to spend more time on dynamic sorting and grouping based on the fields given.

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!
This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=volfJt7mupo&t=12s) served as the base example for accomplishing image caching. I also used this [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14974331/string-to-phone-number-format-on-ios) for phone number formatting.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
This was a fun challenge. Thanks for the opportunity.
